FaderVR is a dashboard developed for virtual reality that will empower journalists and the public to track Internet shaming and empathy. Fader will provide users with the ability to set filters for key search, social and community data related to journalism and public discourse. It will enable the mapping of digital diasporas that evolve from memes and identify key influencers and opportunities for sentiment and trend analysis.
